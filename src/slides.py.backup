tf.text = "Attention is a mechanism that allows a model to focus on specific parts of an input when processing it."
tf = body.add_paragraph()
tf.text = "Self-Attention is a type of attention mechanism where the model attends to different parts of its own input, rather than attending to a separate external memory."

p = text_frame.add_paragraph()
p.text = "One of the main drawbacks of GPT-3 and ChatGPT is their cost. These models require significant computational resources to train and run, making them cost-prohibitive for many organizations. Additionally, these models are only as good as the data they are trained on, so any biases in the training data will be reflected in the output."
p = text_frame.add_paragraph()
p.text = "Another challenge is the lack of transparency in the model's decision-making process. Because GPT-3 and ChatGPT are neural networks, it can be difficult to understand how they arrived at a particular output. This can make it challenging to identify and correct errors or biases in the model's output."

# Future of these tools slide

p.text = "The future of GPT-3 and ChatGPT is promising. As these models continue to improve, they have the potential to transform a wide range of industries, from healthcare to finance. Additionally, advancements in natural language understanding and generation will likely lead to more human-like interactions with these models, making them more accessible to non-technical users."
p = text_frame.add_paragraph()
p.text = "However, it is important to note that these models are still in the early stages of development and there is still much to be done to improve their performance and address issues such as bias and transparency. Additionally, there is a need for more research in areas such as explainability and fairness to ensure that these models are used ethically and responsibly."
